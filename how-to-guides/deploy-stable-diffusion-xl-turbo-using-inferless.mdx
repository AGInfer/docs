description: "Stability AI unveiled SDXL Turbo, a technology that facilitates high-quality image generation in just one step, utilizing an advanced distillation technique known as Adversarial Diffusion Distillation"
---

## Introduction

SDXL Turbo achieves state-of-the-art performance, allowing for the generation of high-quality images in a single step. It has reduced the necessary step count from 50 to a mere one. SDXL Turbo is based on a distillation technique known as [Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD)](https://stability.ai/research/adversarial-diffusion-distillation), SDXL Turbo empowers the model to produce image outputs seamlessly in a single step. Additionally, it enables the generation of real-time text-to-image outputs with sustained high sampling fidelity.

## Our Observations

We have deployed this model using A100 GPU and observed that the model took an average cold start time of `8.03sec` and an average inference time of `90ms` for single-step image generation.

## Defining Dependencies

We are using the HuggingFace [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library for the deployment.

## Constructing the GitHub/GitLab Template

Now quickly construct the GitHub/GitLab template, this process is mandatory and make sure you don't add any file named `model.py`

```
stable-video-diffusion/
├── app.py
├── inferless-runtime-config.yaml
├── inferless.yaml
└── input_schema.py
```

You can also add other files to this directory.

## Create the class for inference

In the [app.py](https://github.com/inferless/inferless_tutorials/blob/main/image_generation/SDXL-Turbo/app.py) we will define the class and import all the required functions

1.  `def initialize`: In this function, you will initialize your model and define any `variable` that you want to use during inference.

```
class InferlessPythonModel:
  def initialize(self):
    vae = AutoencoderKL.from_pretrained("madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
    self.pipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained("stabilityai/sdxl-turbo",vae=vae, torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16",use_safetensors=True)
    self.pipeline = self.pipeline.to("cuda")
    self.pipeline.unet = torch.compile(self.pipeline.unet, mode="reduce-overhead", fullgraph=True)
```

2.  `def infer`: This function gets called for every request that you send. Here you can define all the steps that are required for the inference. You can also pass custom values for inference through the `inputs` parameter.

```
  def infer(self, inputs):
    prompt = inputs["prompt"]
    pipeline_output_image = self.pipeline(prompt=prompt, num_inference_steps=1, guidance_scale=0.0).images[0]
    buff = BytesIO()
    pipeline_output_image.save(buff, format="PNG")
    img_str = base64.b64encode(buff.getvalue())
    return {"generated_image_base64": img_str.decode('utf-8')}
```

3.  `def finalize`: This function cleans up all the allocated memory.

```
    def finalize(self,*args):
        self.pipeline = None
```

## Creating the Custom Runtime

This is a mandatory step where we allow the users to upload their own custom runtime through [inferless-runtime-config.yaml](https://github.com/inferless/inferless_tutorials/blob/main/image_generation/SDXL-Turbo/inferless-runtime-config.yaml).

```
build:
  cuda_version: "12.1.1"
  system_packages:
    - "libssl-dev"
  python_packages:
    - "diffusers==0.24.0"
    - "pandas==2.1.4"
    - "torch==2.1.0"
    - "transformers==4.36.1"
    - "accelerate==0.25.0"
```

## Deploying the model on Inferless

Inferless supports multiple ways of [importing your model](https://docs.inferless.com/model-import/file-structure-requirements). For this tutorial, we will use GitHub. 

### Step 1: Login to the inferless dashboard can click on Import model button
Navigate to your desired workspace in Inferless and Click on `Add a custom model` button that you see on the top right. An import wizard will open up.

### Step 2: Follow the UI to complete the model  Import
* Select the GitHub/GitLab Integration
* Select the GitHub Repo that has the model code and enter the model name
* Choose the type of machine, and specify the minimum and maximum number of replicas for deploying your model
* Optionally you can configure Automatic build,
* Configure Custom Runtime ( If you have pip or apt packages), and Environment variables like Inference Timeout / Container Concurrency / Scale Down Timeout 
* Let the Validation Complete and click on Import button

### Step 3: Wait for the model build to complete usually takes ~5-10 minutes

### Step 4: Use the APIs to call the model
Once the model is in 'Active' status you can click on the 'API' page to call the model

### Here is the Demo:

_Note: This demo GIF shows the deployment of the Stable Video Diffusion model using webhook._

## Method B: Deploying the model on Inferless CLI

Inferless allows you to deploy your model using Inferless-CLI. Follow the steps to deploy using Inferless CLI.

### Initialization of the model

Create the app.py and inferless-runtime-config.yaml, move the files to the working directory. Run the following command to initialize your model:

```
inferless init
```

### Upload the custom runtime

Once you have created the inferless-runtime-config.yaml file, you can run the following command:

```
inferless runtime upload
```

Upon entering this command, you will be prompted to provide the configuration file name. Enter the name and ensure to update it in the inferless.yaml file. Now you are ready for the deployment.

### Deploy the Model

Execute the following command to deploy your model. Once deployed, you can track the build logs on the Inferless platform:

```
inferless deploy
```
