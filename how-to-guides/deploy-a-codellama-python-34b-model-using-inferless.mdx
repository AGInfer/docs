title: "Deploy a CodeLlama-Python-34B Model using Inferless"
description: "In this tutorial, we'll show the deployment process of a quantized GPTQ model using vLLM. We are deploying a GPTQ, 4-bit quantized version of the codeLlama-Python-34B model."
---

## Experimentation with different libraries

We have considered using 4 different inference libraries and tested the CodeLlama-34b-Python model with a max\_token of 512, with the default configuration of all the inference libraries. 

1.  [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers): Transformer provides an easy-to-use pipeline for quick deployment of LLM but is not a good choice for LLM inference. We have used BitsandBytes with 4bit quantization, however it didn't help in improving the inference latency.

2.  [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ): AutoGPTQ enables you to run LLM on low memory. We deploy a GPTQ 4bit quantized model and are able to achieve better inference latency and token/sec than Hugging Face(unquantized and [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)).

3.  [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) (TGI): TGI allows you to deploy and serve LLM. We have deployed and tested different type of quantized versions where 4bit quantized AWQ perform better.

4.  [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm): vLLM is a library use for deployment and serving LLM. We have deployed both quantized and unquantized versions, both using vLLM and vLLM as a backend with the Triton inference server. We have used [vLLM-GPTQ](https://github.com/chu-tianxiang/vllm-gptq)(vLLM GPTQ brach) for deploying GPTQ quantized model, as of 24/11/23 vLLM doesn't support GPTQ quantization.


### Our Observations

In our experiment, we found that using the vLLM with GPTQ 4bit quantized model is a good setup. You can expect an average lowest latency of `3.51 sec` and average token generation rate of `58.40/sec`. This setup has an average cold start time of `21.8 sec`. 

Note: You can _use the_ [_vLLM-GPTQ_](https://github.com/chu-tianxiang/vllm-gptq) _to deploy the same._ 

### GPU Recommendation

We recommend the users to use NVIDIA A100(80GB) GPU to achieve similar results.

## Defining Dependencies

This tutorial utilizes `vLLM` to load and serve the model. Define this library on the inferless-runtime-config.yaml file which you need to upload during the deployment.

## Constructing the Github/Gitlab Template

While uploading your model from GitHub/Gitlab, you need to follow this format:

```
codellama-34b-python/
├── app.py
├── inferless-runtime-config.yaml
├── inferless.yaml
└── input_schema.py
```

* The[ app.py](https://github.com/inferless/inferless_tutorials/blob/main/code_generation/CodeLlama-34B/app.py) (Check the Github URL) file will load and serve the model.

* The [inferless-runtime-config.yaml](https://github.com/inferless/inferless_tutorials/blob/main/code_generation/CodeLlama-34B/inferless-runtime-config.yaml) (Check the Github URL) file will have all the software and Python dependencies.

* You can also have any additional dependency files.

## Creating the class for inference

In the [app.py](https://github.com/inferless/inferless_tutorials/blob/main/code_generation/CodeLlama-34B/app.py) (Check the Github URL) file, first, you will import all the required classes and functions and then create a model class, for example, "InferlessPythonModel".This class will have three functions:

1.  `def initialize`: This function will load the model and tokenizer into the memory whenever the container starts.  
```  
def initialize(self):  
        self.llm = LLM(  
          model="TheBloke/CodeLlama-34B-Python-GPTQ",  
          quantization="gptq")  
```

2.  `def infer`: This function helps to serve the loaded model. You can create a complex inference pipeline or chain multiple models together here.  
```  
def infer(self, inputs):  
        prompts = inputs["prompt"]  
        sampling_params = SamplingParams(  
            temperature=1.0,  
            top_p=1,  
            max_tokens=512  
        )  
        result = self.llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)  
        result_output = [output.outputs[0].text for output in result]  
  
        return {"result": result_output[0]}  
```

3.  `def finalize`: This function deallocates the allocated memory for the model and tokenizer whenever the container shuts down.  
```  
def finalize(self,*args):  
    self.llm = None  
```

## Creating the custom runtime

Whenever you upload the model through GitHub/GitLab, you must upload a custom runtime, i.e. a `inferless-runtime-config.yaml` file. This allows the user to add all the system and Python packages required for the model. For this tutorial, we are using the `libssl-dev` system package, and we use the Python packages mentioned in section 1.

```
build:
  cuda_version: "12.1.1"
  system_packages:
    - "libssl-dev"
  python_packages:
    - "accelerate"
    - "transformers"
    - "git+https://github.com/chu-tianxiang/vllm-gptq.git"
```

## Method A: Deploying the model on Inferless Platform

Inferless supports multiple ways of [importing your model](https://docs.inferless.com/model-import/file-structure-req/file-structure-requirements). For this tutorial, we will use GitHub. 

### Step 1: Login to the inferless dashboard can click on Import model button
Navigate to your desired workspace in Inferless and Click on `Add a custom model` button that you see on the top right. An import wizard will open up.

### Step 2: Follow the UI to complete the model  Import
* Select the GitHub/GitLab Integration
* Select the Github Repo that has the model code and enter the model name
* Choose the type of machine, and specify the minimum and maximum number of replicas for deploying your model
* Optionally you can configure Automatic build,
* Configure Custom Runtime ( If you have pip or apt packages), and Environment variables like Inference Timeout / Container Concurrency / Scale Down Timeout 
* Let the Validation Complete and click on Import button

### Step 3: Wait for the model build to complete usually takes ~5-10 minutes

### Step 4: Use the APIs to call the model
Once the model is in 'Active' status you can click on the 'API' page to call the model

### Here is the Demo:

## Method B: Deploying the model on Inferless CLI

Inferless allows you to deploy your model using Inferless-CLI. Follow the steps to deploy using Inferless CLI.

### Initialization of the model

Create the app.py and inferless-runtime-config.yaml, move the files to the working directory. Run the following command to initialize your model:

```
inferless init
```

### Upload the custom runtime

Once you have created the inferless-runtime-config.yaml file, you can run the following command:

```
inferless runtime upload
```

Upon entering this command, you will be prompted to provide the configuration file name. Enter the name and ensure to update it in the inferless.yaml file. Now you are ready for the deployment.

### Deploy the Model

Execute the following command to deploy your model. Once deployed, you can track the build logs on the Inferless platform:

```
inferless deploy
```
