Once you have made sure the model file structure is in the right format, you can upload the model to Inferless using the "Import Model" option

* Choose the source as `"File"` and Choose` "Model repository"`

* Authenticate and connect your GCP Account.

* You would need to input the `model id `and the `model artifact location` as required. You can view the same under `Model Registry `\-> `Model Name` \-> `Select a Version` \-> `"Version Details".`
