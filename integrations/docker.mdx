You can provide a custom docker image to host your model on the inferless platform. Supported formats for custom docker images.

* Private Image URI

* Dockerfile

#### For Private image URI

* Docker Hub

* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

#### Providers for Dockerfile

* GitHub Repository

* Gitlab Project


An Inferless Platform can pull or build the image based on the format and host the model.

## Integration for Private Image URI

### Requirements for Docker Import

* The image should be created for the platform `linux/amd64`

* These are details that are needed while importing the model from DockerHub or ECR  
   * **Health check API**:- GET API - returns status 200 for a healthy state  
   * **Infer API** \- POST API - returns s dict  
   * **Server Port** \- The port on which the model server is running  
   * **Input - Sample** Json input for model inference

```
# Sample Input 
{
  "prompt":  "Once upon a time ", 
  "max_length": 50
}
```


## For Docker File Integration

### Requirements for Docker Import

* These are details that are needed while importing the model from GITHUB or GITLAB  
   * **Health check API**:- GET API - returns status 200 for a healthy state  
   * **Infer API** \- POST API - Returns s Dict  
   * **Server Port** \- The Port on which the model server is hosted  
   * **Input - Sample** Json input for model inference  
   * **Dockerfile** \- The file for building the Docker
