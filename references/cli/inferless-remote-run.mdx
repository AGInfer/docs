title: "inferless remote run"
---
Use the command `inferless remote-run` to run model inference on remote GPU from your local machine.
This command will execute a particular function or class in the cloud environment.

### Pre Requisites 

- You need to have python 3.10 
- You need to have inferless-cli and inferless installed in the python env 
- Max time 10 mins is allowed for remote run ( For your python code )

### Getting Started 

Let's assume you have an app.py with 2 functions init and load, You need to 4 lines of code to your app.py to make it run with remote run by initialising the inferless cls and adding functional annotations 

```python 
from threading import Thread
from inferless import Cls # Add the inferless library 


InferlessCls = Cls(gpu="A10")  # Init the class with the type of GPU you want to run with 
class InferlessPythonModel:

    @InferlessCls.load     # Add the annotation 
    def initialize(self):
        import torch
        from transformers import pipeline
        self.generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M",device=0)

   @InferlessCls.infer    # Add the annotation 
    def infer(self, inputs):
        message = inputs['message']
        pipeline_output = self.generator(prompt, do_sample=True, min_length=120)
        generated_txt = pipeline_output[0]["generated_text"]
        return {"generated_text": generated_txt }

model = InferlessPythonModel() # Call the test classs 
print(model.infer({'message': 'Hello'}))

````


### Usage

```python
inferless remote-run <filename> 
```

Params:
  - `--config  -c` : Path to the runtime configuration file
  - `--exclude  -e` : Path to the ignore file. This file contains the list of files that you want to exclude from the remote run similar to `.gitignore` file.


Examples:

```python
inferless remote-run app.py -c runtime.yaml 
```

```python
inferless remote-run app.py -c runtime.yaml -e .ignore
```
