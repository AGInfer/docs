### Steps to enable Web-hook 

1.  Make sure you enable auto-build during the model import process.

2.  You can also enable/disable it in the future after import.

3.  You can also choose the branch of the repo where we would enable webhooks.

4.  Based on this selection, Inferless would receive and handle webhooks to automatically update and create new versions of the model.

You can view a sample example below:
