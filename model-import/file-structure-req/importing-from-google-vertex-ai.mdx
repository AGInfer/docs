### Supported Frameworks

Below are the supported frameworks for models that can be uploaded into Inferless.

* Pytorch

* Tensorflow

Any other framework is not currently supported as of now. We will keep adding more frameworks as the support for them is added to our platform

### File structure requirements(Pytorch)

In the case of a `PyTorch` model in Google Vertex AI,

* The model file needs to have a `model.pt` file

* By default, Google Vertex AI creates it as `model.pth`.

To make sure that the model is saved as a `model.pt`, please follow the below instructions.

* For Vertex AI, typically when using the pytorch prebuilt container for training models we create a model archive file as follows :

```python
mar_config = {
        "MODEL_NAME": model_display_name,
        "HANDLER": handler_path,
        "SERIALIZED_FILE": f"{model_artifacts_dir}/",
        "VERSION": model_version,
        "EXTRA_FILES": ",".join(extra_files),
        "EXPORT_PATH": f"{model_mar.path}/model-store",
    }    # generate model archive command
    archiver_cmd = (
        "torch-model-archiver --force "
        f"--model-name {mar_config['MODEL_NAME']} "
        f"--serialized-file {mar_config['SERIALIZED_FILE']} "
        f"--handler {mar_config['HANDLER']} "
        f"--version {mar_config['VERSION']}"
    )
```

* Since Inferless runtime for pytorch supports [model.pt](http://model.pt/) format, the `<pytorch-model-file>` specified above should be of .pt format.  
   * Eg: `"SERIALIZED_FILE": f"{model_artifacts_dir}/` `model.pt` `"`

* Please ensure to save your model in `.pt format `and in your `custom_handler.py` file do the necessary changes to load the model from `.pt `file.

* You can now use this model file to import your file into Inferless.

You can view a example below on how we stored a file as per the steps above:

### `**Tensorflow**` 

* There is no need for any additional steps/file modifications. The Vertex AI link of the generated model can directly be used for import.
