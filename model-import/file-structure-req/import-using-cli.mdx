## Introduction

Inferless allows you to deploy your model using CLI, which has similar file structure requirements to the GUI platform. 

## Mandatory File

When you want to deploy your models through CLI, you must have the file `app.py`. When you run the command `inferless init`, you are required to have this file in your root folder.

`app.py`: This file will have the `InferlessPythonModel` class, which will contain the below functions(Mandatory)

1.  `def initialize(self) `

2.  `def infer(self, inputs) `

3.  `def finalize(self) `

`input_schema.py`

This file should have all the inputs that you are taken 

```input_schema
INPUT_SCHEMA = {
    "prompt": {
        'datatype': 'STRING',
        'required': True,
        'shape': [1],
        'example': ["There is a fine house in the forest"]
    }
}
```


While running the command `inferless init`, all the other files required for the deployment will be created and the user can update these files according to their requirements.

## Files structure

This is an example of the file structure required for the deployment of the [CodeLlama-34b-python model](https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-34b-hf) using Inferless-CLI.

```python
codellama-34b-python/
├── app.py
├── inferless-config.yaml
├── inferless.yaml
└── input_schema.py 
# Depreciated 
├── input.json
└── output.json
```

User can update the following file according to their requirements.

* `inferless-runtime-config.yaml`This file will have all the software packages and the Python packages required for the model inferencing.

* `inferless.yaml`This file will have all the configurations required for the deployment. Users can update this file according to their requirements.

* `input_schema.py `This file will have all the configurations required for the deployment. Users can update this file according to their requirements.

**Deprecated - Input / Output Json** 

* `input.json`This file will have the key for the input parameter. Whenever you change the name of the key in the `app.py`, update it accordingly.

* `output.json`This file will have the `name` of the output key that the `def infer` the function is going to return.


Once these files are ready, you can use the command `inferless deploy` to deploy your model.
