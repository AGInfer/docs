title: "Importing from Github"
---

Before you upload your custom model from Github, make sure you go through and follow the prerequisites conditions mentioned below.

### File structure requirements

The below format should be kept in mind while loading your code to Inferless from GitHub.

1.  The mandatory requirement would be an "`app.py" file.`

2.  This file should contain the below functions(Mandatory)  
   1.  `def initialize(self) `  
   2.  `def infer(self, inputs) `  
   3.  `def finalize(self) `

3.  You can have other files/modules along with the "`app.py" `file in case of any dependencies.

4.  You should also have a file `input_schema.py` if not then you will need to define

Github: [https://github.com/infer-less/template-method](https://github.com/infer-less/template-method)

```python
# app.py - Implement the Load function here for the model 
    def initialize(self):
        self.generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M",device=0)

    
# Function to perform inference 
    def infer(self, inputs):
        # inputs is a dictionary where the keys are input names and values are actual input data
        # e.g. in the below code the input name is "prompt"
        prompt = inputs["prompt"]
        pipeline_output = self.generator(prompt, do_sample=True, min_length=20)
        generated_txt = pipeline_output[0]["generated_text"]
        # The output generated by the infer function should be a dictionary where keys are output names and values are actual output data
        # e.g. in the below code the output name is "generated_txt"
        return {"generated_text": generated_txt}

# perform any cleanup activity here
    def finalize(self,args):
        self.pipe = None
```

```python
# input_schema.py
INPUT_SCHEMA = {
    "prompt": {
        'datatype': 'STRING',
        'required': True,
        'shape': [1],
        'example': ["There is a fine house in the forest"]
    }
}
```


### Supported Libraries

The below libraries are only supported in the current version. Make sure that the "`app.py" `requires libraries only from the below list: 

* transformers

* torch

* tensorflow

* onnx

* onnxruntime

* numpy

* pandas

* diffusers

* Pillow

* pytesseract

* opencv

In case your use case requires any additional library, feel free to raise a support request with us using the help desk or contact us at `support@inferless.com` and we would be happy to discuss and take the request on a case-case basis.

Once you have made sure of the above conditions, click [here](/integrations/git-custom-code) to know more about how to import this model from Github to Inferless.
