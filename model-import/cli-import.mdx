1. Login to [Inferless.com](https://inferless.com/) console and copy the CLI keys from [Keys section](https://console.inferless.com/user/settings?current-tab=keys) here
2. Now install Inferless CLI package using this command
    
    ```bash
     pip install inferless-cli
    ```
    
3. Login to Inferless CLI using this command and paste the CLI keys here, you’ll be logged in
    
    ```bash
    inferless login
    ```
    

### Sample model deployment

1. To deploy a model with Inferless you would ideally require 3 files
    - `app.py` is a Python file that plays a crucial role in setting up and running models on the Inferless platform. It typically contains a class with three main functions:
    - `input_schema.py` is a python file specifies the input parameters for your model's API calls.
    - `config.yaml(Runtime)` refers to the software and dependencies you can add to your runtime environment to support your model's specific needs.
2. To get started with your first deployment we will provide you `app.py` and `input_schema.py`. Run this command to download the files
    
    ```bash
    inferless scaffold --demo 
    ```
    
3. Now that the files are downloaded. Initialise the model using this command
    
    ```bash
    inferless init --name <modelname>
    ```
    
4. Once the model is initialised. Deploy it using this command
    
    ```bash
     inferless deploy --gpu T4 
    ```
    
5. Hurray! You’ve successfully deployed your first model with us

### Volumes

Volumes in Inferless are NFS-like writable storage spaces that can be connected to multiple replicas simultaneously. They serve several key purposes:

1. Storing model parameters
2. Archiving datasets (similar to centralized storage)
3. Setting up shared caches for collaborative tasks

### Creating and uploading weights

1. To create a new volume. Run this command
    
    ```bash
    inferless volume create --name <volumename>
    ```
    
2. New volume will be created and you will be shown the `infer_path` where you can store the weights. Make sure you keep this handy
3. Once the volume is created. Upload the weights using this command and paste the `infer_path` in the destination
    
    ```bash
    inferless volume cp --source <source_path> --destination <remote_path (Infer path)>
    ```
    
4. Your files will be copied to the server and your volume is ready to be used.
5. To use these weights, in `app.py` you can specify the mount path from where the weights can be accessed (Eg: `/var/nfs-mount/<volume_name>`)
    
    ```json
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
    import torch
    from io import BytesIO
    import base64
    
    MODEL_WEIGHTS_DIR =  "/var/nfs-mount/my_volume"
    
    class InferlessPythonModel:    
        def initialize(self):
            self.pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
                "/var/nfs-mount/my_volume",
                use_safetensors=True,
                torch_dtype=torch.float16,
                device_map='auto'
                local_files_only=True
            )
    ```
    
6. Run the command to create a new model using the above model weights 
    
    ```bash
    inferless init --name <modelname>
    ```
    
7. Once the model is initialized. Deploy it using this command (Make sure the path defined inside `app.py` and here in the command should be same)
    
    ```bash
    inferless deploy --gpu t4 --region <regionname> --volume <volumename> --mountpath mount_path 
    ```
    

### Dockerfile/ Dockerhub

By default, we use the Triton server container, which requires adhering to a specific code and file structure to optimize its functionality. However, if you prefer not to use the Triton server container, you can upload your own Docker image or Dockerfile to create a custom container.

For Inferless to work with the Image you have to meet the following specification :

- **Health check API Path** (GET) - An endpoint that monitors the application's status, ensuring it's running and operational. For the below code, you need to give “/health/live” as the path

```json
@app.get("/health/live")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "running"}
```

- **Infer API** (POST) - An endpoint that processes input data (e.g., text or images) and returns results generated by a model, such as predictions or outputs. ( `--inferapi` )

```json
@app.post("/infer")
def generate_image(request: InferRequest):
    return {"image": img_str.decode('utf-8')}  # Return Base64 string
```

- **Server Port** - The port on which the model server is running ( —port )

```docker
#Dockerfile 

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
```

- **Input (optional)** - Sample JSON input for model inference you can pass this a raw data( —data)  or path the file ( —datapath )

```json
{
  "text" : "a horse near a lake"
}
```

### Dockerfile

If you’ve a dockerfile with you, we can build the image. Just make sure you’re dockerfile is stored in Github/ Gitlab for us to access it.

1. Login to [Inferless.com](https://inferless.com/) and click on three dot menu near the profile picture
2. Click on [Manage integrations](https://console.inferless.com/user/integration) and connect with your Github/ Gitlab account were the model is stored.
3. Once you’re done with integration on console. Open CLI and run this command to initialise the model
    
    ```bash
    inferless init docker --type dockerfile --name <modelname> --provider <github/gitlab> --url <repoURL> --healthapi <apiname> --inferapi <apiname> --dockerfilepath <path> --serverport <portnumber> --autobuild 
    ```
    
4. Now that your model is initialised. 
    - To do default deployment use this
    
    ```bash
    inferless deploy --gpu t4 
    ```
    
    - To do customised deployment use this
    
    ```bash
    inferless deploy --gpu t4 --region <regionname> --runtime <runtimename> --volume <volumename> --fractional
    ```
    

### Dockerhub/ ECR

You can deploy the model with Inferless using docker image. Just make sure the image is stored either in dockerhub/ ecr

1. Connect your [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) account using this command(below) and enter the username and access token
    
    ```bash
    inferless integration add dockerhub --name <integrationname> --username <name> --access-token <token>
    ```
    
2. Once you’re done with integration. Run this command to initialise the model
    
    ```bash
    inferless init-docker --type dockerimage --name <modelname> --provider <dockerhub/ecr> --url <imageurl> --healthapi <apiname> --inferapi <apiname> --serverport <portnumber> --autobuild 
    ```
    
3. Now that your model is initialised. 
    - To do default deployment use this
    
    ```bash
    inferless deploy --gpu t4 
    ```
    
    - To do customised deployment use this
    
    ```bash
    inferless deploy --gpu t4 --region <regionname> --runtime <runtimename> --volume <volumename> --fractional    
    ```
