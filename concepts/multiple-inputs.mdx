Often time you will want to send 1 or more inputs to your model. Inferless allows you to send multiple inputs to your model. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to handle multiple inputs in Inferless.

To handle multiple inputs you can define the **input\_schema.py** in your GitHub/GitLab repository with 'shape' as -1 which will allow dynamic input sizes.

In input\_schema.py 
```input_schema Example
INPUT_SCHEMA = {
    "prompt": {
        'datatype': 'STRING',
        'required': True,
        'shape': [-1] ,
        'example': ["There is a fine house in the forest"]
    },
}
```

In code app.py

```python 
def infer(self, inputs):
    prompt = inputs["prompt"] 
    # If while making the API call you send shape as [1] you will get the variable, if the array > 1 you will get an array
    if isinstance(prompt, list):
        for each in prompt:
            print(each)
    else:
        print(prompt)
```

You can also flatten it to get all the values in a single list in app.py
```python
def infer(self, inputs):
    prompts = []
    # If while making the API call you send shape as [1] you will get the variable, if the array > 1 you will get an array
    if isinstance(inputs["prompt"], list):
        prompts = inputs["prompt"] 
    else:
        prompts.append(inputs["prompt"])

```

This is how the API call will look like

```shell
curl --location 'https://<>.default.model-v1-dev.inferless.com/v2/models/<model_name>/versions/1/infer' \
          --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          --header 'Authorization: Bearer 432424.....3432423' \
          --data '{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "name": "prompt",
            "shape": [
                3
            ],
            "data": [
                "There is a fine house in the forest", "There is a house in the forest", "There is a tree in the forest"
            ],
            "datatype": "BYTES"
        }
    ]
}'
```
