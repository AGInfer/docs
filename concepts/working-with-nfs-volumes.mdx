title: "Working with NFS - My Volumes"
---

Inferless provides NFS-like writable volumes that support simultaneous connections to various replicas. Similar to networked file-sharing systems that enable collective access to files across a network, these volumes in Inferless address multiple needs:

* Storing model parameters

* Archiving datasets similar to centralized storage

* Setting up a communal cache for collaborative tasks, akin to a shared cache over a network.

## Method A: Create a Volume using Inferless Platform

Here is how you can create a volume `Go to the Volumes` section in your console

#### Step 2

After this Volume is created and ready copy the `Mount Path`

![](/images/vol3.png)

#### Step 3

Use the mount path on your app.py code as shown below :

![](/images/my-volume4.png)

#### Step 4

In the model import step, select the Mount Volume to attach

## Method B: Create a volume using Inferless CLI

Use this command `inferless volume` to see all the functions available for volume.

Manage Inferless volumes 

```console
$ inferless volume COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...
```

**Commands**:

* `create`: Create a new volume.
* `cp`: Add a file or directory to a volume.
* `ls`: List files and directories within a volume.
* `rm`: Specify the Inferless path to the file.
* `list`: List all existing volumes.
* `select`: Select a volume for the current Inferless configuration file.



### `inferless volume list`

This command allows you to list all the volumes present in your workspace. It will help you to get the `ID` of the volume, which is required when you run the `inferless volume select` command.

### `inferless volume select --id`

This command allows you to use any volume that you have created using volume's `id`. Run the following command and update the `volume` directly on the inference configuration file(`inference.yaml`).

```
inferless volume select --id 4e39f657-d115-4cb7-b713-012984213750
```
