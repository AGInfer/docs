Inferless does not allow you to access the root file system, So if you have a model file that need to store or load the files from local storage there are 2 ways you can do this 

* **Method A**: Use the '/tmp' directpry to store the files(Temporary Storage)
* **Method B**: Use My Volume to store the files(Persistant Storage)


### Method A: Use the '/tmp' directory to store the files

Using the '/tmp' directory is a temporary storage and the files will be deleted once the model is stopped. This is ideally good for use cases when you have a audio/video file that you need to process and you don't want to store the files after the processing is done. 

```python
import os


Class MyModel:
    def initialise(self):
        pass

    def infer(self, inputs):
        # Save the file to the /tmp directory
        file_path = "/tmp/myfile.txt"
        with open(file_path, "w") as f:
            f.write("Hello World")

```

### Method B: Use My Volume to store the files(Persistant Storage)

To use the My Volume you need to create a volume and attach it during model import. The files stored in the volume will be available even after the model is stopped. 

```python

VOLUME_PATH = "/var/nfs-share/my-volume"

import os
Class MyModel:
    def initialise(self):
        # Load file from nfs mount
        file_path = os.path.join(VOLUME_PATH, "myfile.txt")
        with open(file_path, "r") as f:
            print(f.read())
    

    def infer(self, inputs):
        # Save the file to the volume
        file_path = os.path.join(VOLUME_PATH, "myfile.txt")
        with open(file_path, "w") as f:
            f.write("Hello World")
