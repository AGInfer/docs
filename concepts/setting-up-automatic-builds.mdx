With Inferless, you can automatically build your model from various sources like Github, Hugging Face, Docker, AWS S3 where you don't worry about pushing newer version of your model. Inferless will automatically build the model for you.

There are 2 wasy to set up automatic builds on Inferless:

1. **Automatic Build from Git Based Deployments**

If you are using Github/Gitlab integration with Inferless, you can set up automatic builds by specifying the 'branch' checking the automatic build checkbox.


2 **Automatic Build from via Webhooks**

If you are using Hugging Face, Docker, AWS S3, GCP or any other source, you can set up automatic builds by setting up webhooks. 


### Example of Automatic Build from Hugging Face
