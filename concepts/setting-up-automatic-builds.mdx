title: "Automatic Build on Inferless"
---
With Inferless, you can automatically build your model from various sources like Github, Hugging Face, Docker, and AWS S3 without worrying about pushing newer versions of your model. Inferless will automatically build the model for you.

## Two Ways to Set Up Automatic Builds

#### 1. Automatic Build from Git-Based Deployments
If you are using Github/Gitlab integration with Inferless, you can set up automatic builds by specifying the 'branch' and checking the automatic build checkbox.

#### 2. Automatic Build via Webhooks
If you are using Hugging Face, Docker, AWS S3, GCP, or any other source, you can set up automatic builds by configuring webhooks.

## Setting Up Automatic Build from Hugging Face

### Step 1: Find the Webhook URL

- You can get the API URL which would be displayed during the model import.

- You can review the webhook URL on the review page:

- If you're setting this up after model import, you can find the URL under `Model page -> Versions`:

### Step 2: Configure Hugging Face Webhook
- Log into your Hugging Face account containing the model you wish to load
- Navigate to `Settings` â†’ `Webhooks`
- Click "Add a new Webhook"
- Select the target repository (your model)
- Add the API URL you obtained from Inferless
- Enable the `Repo Update` option under triggers
- Click "Create Webhook" to complete the setup

Here's how your completed webhook configuration should look:
