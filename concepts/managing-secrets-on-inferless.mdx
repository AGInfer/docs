title: "Managing Secrets on Inferless"
---

Secrets Manager is a tool for securely storing and managing sensitive information, including passwords, API keys, and tokens. It is designed to prevent the embedding of secrets in application code or scripts, which poses a security risk if the code is exposed.

1.  **Centralized Storage**: Secrets are stored in a centralized location, making it easier to manage and audit access.

2.  **Access Control**: Fine-grained access controls allow only authorized applications, services, or users to retrieve certain secrets.

3.  **Encryption**: Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit, ensuring that they cannot be easily intercepted or read by unauthorized entities.

4.  **Rotation**: Many Secrets Managers support or enforce the rotation of secrets, allowing credentials to be updated regularly without manual intervention.

Secrets are available at a user level and can be only updated by the one who is doing that particular model import
