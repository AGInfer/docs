title: "Deploy Serverless"

## **What is the difference between our Serverless and Serverless Containers?** 

**Serverless** allows for swift cold starts when deploying ML models. At present, our Serverless function supports only model/python backends. Should you have specialized software packages, it's advisable to utilize a serverless container, enabling you to integrate those packages.

## Key Advantages of Choosing Serverless:

* Simplified Workflow: No infrastructure management lets you concentrate on code and data.

* Rapid Cold Starts: Experience faster initialization of your services, reducing client wait times to up to 3 seconds

* Adaptive Autoscaling: Adjusts according to demand, ensuring optimal resource allocation.

* Efficient Deployment: Streamline your ML rollouts without the operational bottlenecks.

* Maintenance-Free Environment: Stay updated without the manual intervention of software patches. Ready Integration: Deploy with Nvidia Triton Inference Server effortlessly.

## Serverless Limitations to Consider:

* Absence of custom runtime containers support.

* Limited options between full and fractional GPUs.

* Batching configurations might not cover advanced setups.

## How does it work?

1.  **Select your model import type -** Select the model you want to deploy. You can deploy a custom model available on the HuggingFace/AWS/ GCP for NLP, computer vision, or other task types

2.  **Define the model configuration -** Enter the details for the model/model weights. You can do Git repo / HF repo / S3 here to specify the model details based on the previous step

3.  **Choose your infra configuration -** Upon completion of the call, based on your configuration, we would autoscale down your container, thus saving you in inference costs. You would be charged only for the inference used.

4.  **Create and manage your endpoint -** You can load your model into a machine of your choice. As of now, we offer 2 kinds of machines:  
   1.  NVIDIA A10: The NVIDIA A10 is a high-performance graphics processing unit (GPU) designed for a variety of demanding workloads including machine learning inference. It used Ampere architecture to provide a substantial performance boost over the T4, which is based on the older Turing architecture.

5.  **Call your APIs in Production -** You can get the endpoint details and the Model Workspace API keys. Simply call the model in production and enjoy the services.


## How does Billing for Serverless work? 

Your invoice will comprise: 

* **Setup Time:** The duration required to load the model weights. Remarkably, Serverless trims this to one-third of container times.

* **Inference Time:** The actual processing time for an inference.

* **Eviction Timeout:** A custom setting dictating the 'warm' status duration for models. Adjustable between 5 seconds and 60 minutes.

**Real-world Billing Example:** Visualize a deployment scenario on A10G dedicated, incurring 9 seconds for a cold start and 5 seconds for inference. For 1000 daily requests, where 10% hit a cold start:

Billed Duration: (10% of 1000 requests \* 9 seconds) + (1000 requests \* 5 seconds) = 5900 seconds.

**Your Bill:** 5900 seconds \* $0.00034 = $2.006.
