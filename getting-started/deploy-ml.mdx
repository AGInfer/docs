title: Deploy a ML Model with Inferless
description: There are several ways to import your model, but for the purpose of this example, we will be using Hugging Face. By the end of this tutorial, you will have the ability to deploy a Hugging Face model in Inferless.
---
## Pre Requisite : Note the Model Name, Type and Framework

*   Navigate to the Hugging Face model page of your choice that you want to import into Inferless.
*   Take note of the `"Model Name"` (you can also use the copy button), `Task Type`, `Model Framework,` and `Model Type`. These will be required for the next steps.

### Step 1: Add Model in your workspace.

* Navigate to your desired workspace in Inferless and Click on `"Add a custom model" `button that you see on the top right. An import wizard will open up.

###  Step 2: Choose the Model Provider
* Since we are using a model from Hugging Face in this example, select `Huggingface `as the method of uploading from the `Provider` list.

* To proceed with the upload, you will need to connect your `Huggingface account `and a private `GitHub account`. This is a mandatory step as the Hugging Face credentials enable us to import your private repositories, while GitHub creates the template of the Hugging face repo where you can make changes later to modify your pre-processing and post-processing function
* **For more information:** Inferless works by copying the model from Hugging Face and creating a new repository in GitHub. The model repository is then loaded into Inferless.

* After Huggingface and GitHub integration.

### Step 3: Enter the model details 

* **Model Details: In this step, Add your `model name`(The name that you wish to call your model), Choose the `model type`(Eg: Transformer), Choose the `task type` (Eg: Text generation) and `Huggingface model name`.

   * In case you would like to set up `Automatic rebuild` for your model, enable it  
         * You would need to set up a webhook for this method. Click [here](/model-import/automatic-build-via-webhooks) for more details.


### Step 4: Configure Machine and Environment.
* Choose the type of machine, and specify the minimum and maximum number of replicas for deploying your model.
         * **Min scale** \-  
         ```  
         The number of inference workers to keep on at all times.  
         ```  
         * **Max scale -**  
         ```  
         The maximum number of inference workers to allow at any point of time  
         ``` 
         * Configure Custom Runtime ( If you have pip or apt packages), choose Volume, Secrets and set Environment variables like Inference Timeout / Container Concurrency / Scale Down Timeout

### Step 5: Review your model details

* Once you click "Continue," you will be able to review the details added for the model.

* If you would like to make any changes, you can go back and make the changes.

* Once you have reviewed everything, click `Deploy` to start the model import process.

### Step 6 : Run your model

* Once you click submit, the model import process would start.  
   * It may take some time to complete the import process, and during this time, you will be redirected to your workspace and can see the status of the import under `"In Progress/Failed"` tab.

   * If you encounter any errors during the model import process or if you want to view the build logs for any reason, you can click on the three dots menu and select "View build logs". This will show you a detailed log of the import process, which can help you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.  
   * Post-upload, the model will be available under "My Models"  
   * You can then select the model and go to `-> API -> Inference Endpoint details. `Here you would find the API endpoints that can be called. You can click on the copy button on the right and can call your model.
