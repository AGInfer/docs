title: "15th April 2024: Runtime Flexibility, Build Efficiency, and Autoscaling Improvements"
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**

1. **Enhanced Runtime Configuration:** You can now include shell commands in your Runtime.yaml that execute sequentially during runtime build. This feature is particularly useful for packages that require step-by-step installation procedures. For more details on bringing custom packages, please visit our [documentation](https://docs.inferless.com/model-import/bring-custom-packages)

2. **Reduced Build Times:** We have implemented changes that significantly reduce the build time for model imports. 

3. **Improved Autoscaling:** Enhancements to our autoscaling capabilities now provide additional buffer capacity during peak hours. This ensures that your operations can scale smoothly and effectively, meeting demand without compromising performance.

4. **Improved Runtime Logs:** The logs section for Runtime now includes detailed visibility into all build steps, allowing for better tracking and troubleshooting of custom runtimes.

These updates underline our commitment to providing a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly platform. By continually enhancing our services and infrastructure, we aim to support your needs and empower your projects.
