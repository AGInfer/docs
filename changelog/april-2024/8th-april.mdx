**Latest Enhancements & Features:**

This update bring internal improvements to make platform performance and user experience better: 

1. **Docker Build Synchronization:** We've introduced a new workflow in the inferless-docker service to optimise docker builds, effectively preventing timeouts caused by prolonged build time. 

2. **Infrastructure Stability Improvements:** Significant stability fixes have been applied to the inference pod system, enabling automatic recovery from states of failure and crash backoff loops. 

3. **CLI Enhancement for Runtime Export:** The CLI has been upgraded to support a straightforward command for exporting from Cog runtime to Inferless runtime, simplifying the transition and enhancing usability. 

4. **NVIDIA Driver Update for US East Region:** For customers in region-1, the NVIDIA driver version has been updated from 480 to 525. This change addresses CUDA runtime errors, ensuring smoother operation and compatibility for our users.

These updates underline our commitment to providing a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly platform. By continually enhancing our services and infrastructure, we aim to support your needs and empower your projects.
