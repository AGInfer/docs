title: "31st May 2025: Runtime Flexibility, Faster Remote Run, and Hugging Face Improvements "
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**
1. **Runtime Optimization**: We've removed region restrictions from runtimes. Now, developers can use any runtime in any regionâ€”bringing runtime configs closer to the code and giving you more flexibility during deployment.
2. **ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Import Improvements**: To reduce model import failures, weâ€™ve added validation checksâ€”especially for cases where access to model weights is restricted. Weâ€™ve also introduced vLLM plugin support for faster inference with Hugging Face models.
3. **Remote Run â€“ Speed Enhancements**: HF models used in Remote Run now benefit from caching, making subsequent executions significantly fasterâ€”ideal for quick testing and iteration cycles.
4. **Streaming Logs for Model Import** You can now view logs in real-time during model imports, helping you track build progress more accurately and debug faster.
