**Bug Fixes:**

* **Backend Inference Log Issue:** We have resolved the problem where inference logs were looping or appearing empty in the backend. This fix ensures more accurate and reliable log data, aiding in better system analysis and debugging.

* **Frontend UI Timeout Resolution:** The issue causing the frontend UI to freeze at Step 3 has been fixed. Enhanced error messages and validation have been added for a more intuitive and uninterrupted user journey.

These updates are part of our commitment to delivering a seamless and user-friendly experience.
