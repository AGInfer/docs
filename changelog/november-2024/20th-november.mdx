title: "20th November 2024: Enhance Performance Tracking, New Runtime UI and more"
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**
1. **New Runtime UI:** The Runtime UI has been redesigned for better usability. You can now easily track runtime changes, identify models using specific runtimes, and clean up unused runtimes effortlessly.
2. **Input/Output Tracking in Serverless V2**: Weâ€™ve added Input/Output tracking in Serverless V2, giving you deeper insights into how data flows through your deployments. This is only applicable for beta users with access to latest serverless capabilities.
3. **Enhanced Metrics:** Added percentile-based request latency to provide better visibility into inference performance. The cold start tracker now shows percentiles instead of individual container starts for improved clarity.
4. **Enhanced Autoscaling:** RPS-based scaling has been introduced to maintain low cold start times even at extremely high scales, resulting in significantly better p95 latency.
