title: "30th June 2025: Runtime Updates, Websockets and more "
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**
1. **Runtime Updates:** You can now change the default runtime used by a model and update runtime versions in-place. 
2. **Streaming Logs:** We have rolled-out real-time logs for model imports using WebSockets, giving you live feedback as each step in the import process progresses.
3. **Improved Warm Pool Integration:** The autoscaler now uses Warm Pools more efficiently to accelerate spin-up times during scaling events, reducing cold start delays and improving overall responsiveness.
