**Latest Enhancements & Features:**
1. **Model - Critical Alert Notifications** : You can now receive real-time alerts for critical model events such as inference failures or latency spikes using AWS SNS. Stay informed and react quickly to any issues.Check the [docs here. ](https://docs.inferless.com/integrations/aws-sns/aws-sns)
2. **Docker Support in Serverless V2:** You can now deploy Docker images directly in Serverless V2, giving you full control over your runtime environment and enabling more flexible custom deployments.
3. **Playground Enhancements:** The Playground now tracks API call duration for each inference and a local history of past API calls, helping you test and iterate faster.
4. **Hugging Face Token Auto-Addition**: If you’ve previously saved your Hugging Face token, it will now auto-fill during model deployment from the Explore Models page — saving time and clicks.
