title: "January 29, 2024 - Removal of I/O JSON, Webhook Support for Docker and Improved Runtime Management"
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**

We're excited to bring you the latest features and improvements designed to enhance your experience and efficiency on our platform:

1.  **Removal of Input/Output JSON:** We've eliminated the need for adding Input/Output JSON in the Inferless console. You can now conveniently configure I/O parameters within your app.py code. For more details, please refer to our [Input/Output Schema documentation](https://docs.inferless.com/model-import/input-output-schema).

2.  **Docker CI/CD Integration with Webhook Support:** Docker imports just got more efficient with the introduction of webhook support. This allows for automated updates and management of Docker images. For more details, please refer to [Webhook - Docker documentation](https://docs.inferless.com/model-import/automatic-build-via-webhooks/docker)

3.  **Runtime Management Moved to Workspace Level:** Runtimes have been shifted from the user level to the workspace level, enabling different users to reuse and share runtimes within the same workspace.

4.  **Frontend Support for Region-Specific Volumes:** Users can now create and manage volumes specific to regions (AWS/Azure), providing more control and customization for data storage and accessibility.
