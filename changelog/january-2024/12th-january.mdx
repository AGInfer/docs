title: "12th January 2024 - Enhanced Volume Management, Docker Integration, and Improved Billing Processes"
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**

We are excited to announce our new set of features and improvements, focusing on optimizing developer experience and expanding our platform capabilities:

1.  **Enhanced Volume Sync Support:** CLI customers can now seamlessly push data to Inferless volumes via CLI, enabling direct access to the data across all replica containers. This eliminates the need to pull data in the initialization function, significantly improving the development experience.

2.  **Volume Support for A10G Machines:** Our volume management system now supports A10G machines, allowing customers to utilize region-specific volumes.

3.  **Docker-Based Model Import Feature:** We've expanded our platform's capabilities to support any Docker image and DockerFile, offering greater flexibility in model deployment. For detailed information and guidance, please visit our [documentation on Docker integration](https://docs.inferless.com/integrations/docker).

4.  **Enhanced Exception Handling for Model Import:** We have improved exception handling for model imports, specifically when inputs lack name, shape, or datatype. This results in more robust input parameter validation, ensuring smoother model integration and deployment.

These updates reflect our dedication to evolving our platform to meet the diverse and growing needs of our users.
