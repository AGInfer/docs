title: "18th December : Advanced Monitoring, Better Custom Runtime, and Enhanced Integration Stability"
---

Key Enhancements & Updates:

In our continuous effort to improve efficiency and user experience on our platform, we are excited to share our latest advancements:

1.  **Upgraded to On-Premises Grafana for Superior Monitoring:** We've transitioned from hosted to on-premises Grafana. This strategic move significantly enhances our data point collection capabilities and query response times. It effectively resolves the metrics outage issues previously experienced with the hosted Grafana, leading to more robust and detailed system monitoring.

2.  **Simplified Custom Runtime Management:** Enhancing the user experience in runtime management, we now offer the ability to directly view and edit custom runtime settings on the platform. This update eliminates the cumbersome process of re-uploading files for each change.

3.  **Extended Billing Access for Admin Users:** We have now enabled non-owner users to access billing payment links. This enhancement facilitates easier and more convenient payment procedures for all users & not just console owner.

4.  **GitHub Webhook Stability Improvements:** This improvement ensures more dependable and consistent performance, enhancing overall integration reliability.

We remain committed to continually refining our platform, focusing on delivering a service that is not only robust and efficient but also aligns with the evolving needs of our users.
