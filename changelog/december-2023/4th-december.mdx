---

**Latest Updates & Bug Fixes:**

In our ongoing commitment to enhance the user experience and platform efficiency, we are excited to announce our latest updates:

1.  **Refined CPU Memory UI Settings:** We've updated the UI for CPU memory adjustments to automatically default to the optimal setting based on the selected machine type during deployment. This ensures a more intuitive and efficient setup process.

2.  **Increased Version History Limit to 20:** The version history limit in the UI has been increased from 5 to 20\. This expansion allows for greater access to your build history, enabling more effective tracking and management of past versions.

3.  **Improved Visibility of Input/Output Schema in Model Details:** On the model details page, users can now view the actual input and output schemas. This enhancement provides clearer insights into model settings and streamlines the deployment process.

4.  **Enhanced Volume Value Retention in Reimport/Rebuild:** To prevent data loss and potential import errors, volume values are now consistently retained during reimport or rebuild phases of model deployment.

5.  **Adjustable Inference and Scale-Down Timeout Settings:** We've introduced the ability to customize inference timeout and scale-down timeout settings directly in the model import process.

6.  **AutoBuild UI Update for Accurate Date Tracking:** The AutoBuild feature has been improved to display the correct date, providing a more accurate and user-friendly means of tracking model imports.

**Additional Internal Improvements:**

1.  **In-Build Docker Image Cleanup to avoid Out-of-memory errors:** Implementing weekly clearance of docker image cache to stabilize model builds.

2.  **Expedited Model Booting Process:** Various improvements have been implemented to speed up the model booting process, reducing wait times and improving overall performance.

These updates are part of our commitment to delivering a robust, efficient, and user-friendly platform. We are continuously working on improving our service and appreciate your feedback and support.
