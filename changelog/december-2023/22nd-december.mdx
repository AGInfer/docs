Key Enhancements & Updates:

In our latest release, we are introducing several key enhancements aimed at boosting performance, improving user experience, and expanding functionality:

1.  **Dynamic Interval for Grafana Metrics:** This update significantly speeds up the loading of the metrics page on the UI, ensuring a more responsive and efficient monitoring experience.

2.  **Docker Build Logs with OpenSearch:** Transitioning to OpenSearch for Docker build logs, users can now experience faster and more efficient log retrieval for their containers, enhancing the debugging and monitoring process.

3.  **Detailed Model Health API:** The model health API has been updated to provide more comprehensive details during the booting up and healthy states of models. This offers users better insights into model performance and health.

4.  **Transformer Library Update:** We have updated our default image in the Transformer Library to support advanced models like SDXL and LLama 2\. This update reduces the need for creating custom runtimes and streamlining model deployment and usage.

5.  **Python Async Client for Inferless APIs:** Introducing a Python asynchronous client, this feature allows users to interact with Inferless APIs asynchronously, facilitating non-blocking calls and enhancing overall application performance.

This release further solidifies our commitment to providing a platform that serves you better.
