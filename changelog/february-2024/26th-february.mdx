title: "26th February 2024 - Better Exception Handling, Dynamic Batching Support and more."
---

**What's New:**

This update introduces significant enhancements focused on optimizing model management and deployment, offering more robust exception handling and dynamic operational capabilities. Here's what's new:

1.  **Enhanced Exception Handling for Models:** We've improved the way exceptions are handled for model returns. Now, if a returned object doesn't match the required datatype, a specific error will indicate the expected datatype, facilitating quicker resolution of model import issues.

2.  **Dynamic Batching Support:** Dynamic batching has been made more accessible to users. By utilizing specific flags, users can optimize model performance for varying workload demands. Learn more about configuring dynamic batching in our documentation.

3.  **CI/CD Enhancements for Serverless v2:** The auto-build feature has been extended to Serverless v2 deployments, enabling users to streamline their build and deployment processes for serverless applications. Keep a tab, new version coming soon.

4.  **Automated Integration Test Suite:** Our new integration test suite automatically runs new additional 10 test cases, significantly reducing the likelihood of production errors and ensuring smoother deployments.

These updates are part of our ongoing commitment to enhance the usability and reliability of our platform.
