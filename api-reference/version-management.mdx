### **Enable the Auto Rebuild feature**

* Make sure to enable the auto-rebuild feature either during Model import.

* You can always enable it later in your model settings. Click on the "Automatic build" tab and click on enable in settings as shown below.

### View all builds to date

In case you have enabled auto-rebuild feature for your model, you would be able to view all the builds that have taken place for your model.

When inferless receives a webhook from your chosen provider about a change in the model, we would automatically take that as a new model and deploy it for you.
