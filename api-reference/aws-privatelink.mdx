title: "AWS PrivateLink - Inferless"
---

AWS PrivateLink is an ideal solution for establishing private connectivity between Inferless and your AWS services, your VPC, and on-premises applications without exposing your traffic to the public internet. 

This service enhances security by ensuring that data traverses the Amazon network, significantly reducing the risk of exposure to threats. AWS PrivateLink is especially useful when you need to provide secure and private access to services hosted on AWS . Advantages include simplified network management without the need for IP address management, access control, or firewall rules; reduced data-exfiltration risk; and lower costs due to minimized data transfer charges by keeping traffic within the AWS network.
