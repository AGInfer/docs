title: "Inferless Python Client"
---

### Installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade inferless
```

### Usage

This client can be used to call Inferless API from your Python code. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls.

#### inferless.call

```python
inferless.call(url: str, workspace_api_key: str, data: dict ) -> Response [dict]
```

This method sends a synchronous request to the Inferless API endpoint

#### Parameters

* **url -** Inferless Model API URL

* **workspace\_api\_key -** Inferless Workspace API Key

* **data -** Model Input Data in Dict Format 

* **inputs -** Model Input Data in Inference Protocol format 

### Example

```json
import inferless

URL = ""
API_KEY = ""
data = {"prompt" : "a horse near a beach"}

# This call is synced until the response is returned
result = inferless.call(URL, API_KEY, data)
```

#### inferless.call\_async

```python
inferless.call_async(URL: str, workspace_api_key: str, data: dict, callback=None)
```

This method sends a request to the inferless endpoint in the background.

#### Parameters

* **url -** Inferless Model API URL

* **workspace\_api\_key -** Inferless Workspace API Key

* **data -** Model Input Data in Dict Format

* **inputs -** Model Input Data in Inference Protocol format 

* **callback - The c**allback function to be called after the response is received.  
   * callback function should have two params: `callback(error, response)`  
   * **error -** any error resulting while calling the inferless endpoint  
   * **response -** response from the inferless endpoint

```json

import inferless

URL = ""
API_KEY = ""
data =  {"prompt" : "a horse near a beach"}

# callback function which writes the response to a file
def callback_func(e, response):
    # e is the error object
    # response is the response object
    print(response)

# This is not a blocking call and runs in the background and callback function is triggered to write the endpoint response to a file
inferless.call_async(URL, KEY, DATA, callback_func)
```
